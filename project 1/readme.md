we generated a queue based system as the requirements states that fifo structure 
for that we gone through the following process
first import queue library 
then we declared a var temp to calculate 
number of students waiting in the queue and we displayed four choices to get selected by the canteen keeper 
if the canteeen keeper selects add then he can add the number of students in waiting list for food
then if he or she selects status then he can view the number of students in the queue waiting for food
