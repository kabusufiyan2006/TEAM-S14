first we got two inputs total classes and class attended
and we calculated percentage for both total classes and class attended
and displayed the attendance percentage
then we made a if condition to check whether the student is eligible or not 
if the calculated percentage is greater than minimum percentage
then status is eligible 
otherwise status is not eligible 
and we displyed the classes required to match the requirements
